# TODO  
* Admin needs a lot of work - scheduling rides is broken, editing appts looks bad, approving patients and showing them doesnt work  
* Appointment status needs to be mapped to a readable value "needs driver, upcoming, etc" for all  
* MATCHING ALGORITHM NEEDS TO BE FINISHED  
* Creating appts on patient's end needs to be working better with regards to location  
* Viewing appointment should show the google map
